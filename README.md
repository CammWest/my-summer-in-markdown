## A little about me
My name is Cameron West, I'm in 10th grade, I play club soccer and Highschool soccer. 
## My summer
Over the summer I went to Estonia to visit my mom's family. Another thing I did over summer is watch Netflix and play Brawlstars.
## My acheivements
While in Estonia, my sister was doing private gymanstics lessons and the gym was empty so I spent a lot of time on the trampoline and my goal was to land a front flip. I finally landed it on the 4th day.
## My School Goals
My goals for the school year are to pass my AP tests and get all A's.
## Fun fact
I was born left handed.
